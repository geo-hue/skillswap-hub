# Backend Developer Role Document – SkillSwap Hub

This document outlines the role, responsibilities, and expectations for the Backend Developer working on the SkillSwap Hub project. It serves as a guide for how this role fits into the overall project structure, detailing key responsibilities, technical requirements, deliverables, and integration points with other team members.

---

## 1. Role Overview

As a Backend Developer on SkillSwap Hub, you will be responsible for architecting, designing, and implementing server-side application logic. Your work will ensure the smooth functioning and scalability of the application, managing everything from user authentication and data storage to real-time communications. In this role, you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Developer and other stakeholders to create a responsive and secure backend system that supports the platform's dynamic features. Your contributions are critical in enabling functionalities such as user management, session scheduling, real-time messaging, and overall system performance under load.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

### a. Designing and Implementing Server-Side Logic
- **Task Description:** Develop and maintain the core business logic for the application using Node.js.
- **Practical Example:** Create modular controllers and middleware to handle HTTP requests, process user data, and ensure business rules are applied consistently.
- **Example Code Snippet:**
  ```javascript
  // Example middleware for validating JWT tokens
  const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

  function verifyToken(req, res, next) {
    const token = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (!token) return res.status(403).send('Token is required!');
    
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) return res.status(401).send('Invalid Token');
      req.user = decoded;
      next();
    });
  }

  module.exports = verifyToken;
  ```

### b. Managing User Authentication
- **Task Description:** Implement a secure, JWT-based authentication system, ensuring that users can register, log in, and maintain authenticated sessions.
- **Practical Example:** Develop endpoint routes for user authentication, including registration, login, and password management, incorporating tools like bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Example Considerations:** Secure storage and handling of user credentials, token expiration policies.

### c. Data Storage and Database Management
- **Task Description:** Design database schemas and manage data persistence using either SQL or NoSQL databases based on project requirements.
- **Practical Example:** Develop models to store user profiles, skill listings, session schedules, and messages. Optimize database queries for fast data retrieval.
- **Example Code Snippet (Using Mongoose for MongoDB):**
  ```javascript
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');

  const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    hashedPassword: { type: String, required: true },
    skills: [{ type: String }],
    profile: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Profile' }
  });

  module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
  ```

### d. Implementing Real-Time Communication
- **Task Description:** Develop real-time functionalities using WebSockets to support instant messaging and interactive session scheduling.
- **Practical Example:** Set up WebSocket connections using libraries like Socket.IO to enable real-time notifications and chat features.
- **Considerations:** Handling connection errors, managing multiple socket events, and ensuring synchronized state across clients.

### e. Ensuring API Scalability and Security
- **Task Description:** Optimize RESTful API endpoints for high performance and scalability, including caching strategies and secure data transactions.
- **Practical Example:** Introduce query caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and input validation to mitigate security risks.
- **Example Considerations:** Monitoring API performance and adapting the system architecture in reaction to load metrics.

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Node.js:** Solid experience with Node.js for building scalable, performant server-side logic.
- **RESTful API Development:** Ability to design, implement, and document RESTful endpoints. Familiarity with API versioning and state management.
- **Database Management:** Experience with SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases, including schema design, query optimization, and transaction management.
- **Authentication & Security:** Proficiency in JWT, OAuth, and secure storage practices to ensure user data protection.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Knowledge of WebSocket protocols and libraries such as Socket.IO to implement real-time messaging functionalities.
- **DevOps Fundamentals:** Basic understanding of deployment operations, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and containerization preferred.
- **Performance Optimization:** Skills in caching techniques, efficient coding practices, and API tuning for scalability.

---

## 4. Deliverables

- **API Endpoints Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of all backend routes, including endpoint definitions, request/response formats, and error handling.
- **Authentication System:** Fully functional user login, registration, and authorization flows with JWT integration.
- **Database Models & Migration Scripts:** Well-defined schemas and migration strategies for managing data across different environments.
- **Real-Time Modules:** Working modules for WebSocket-based real-time messaging and notifications.
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Automated tests covering critical backend functionalities to ensure reliability and facilitate future refactoring.
- **Scalability Enhancements:** Performance monitoring, caching implementations, and optimized API endpoints that validate the system's ability to handle high load.

---

## 5. Integration Points

- **Frontend Developer Interface:** Define clear API contracts (e.g., RESTful endpoints) to allow the Frontend Developer to seamlessly integrate backend functionalities with the React-based UI.
- **Database Synchronization:** Coordinate with the data management team (if separate) to optimize database design and ensure data integrity across modules.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Work closely with the Frontend Developer to ensure that real-time events (e.g., notifications, messages) are correctly emitted and handled in the client.
- **DevOps and QA Teams:** Collaborate in setting up and maintaining testing environments, CI/CD pipelines, and proper deployment procedures to maintain system stability.

---

## 6. Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- **Feature Branches:** Develop each feature or bug fix in its own branch, which is then merged into the main branch only after thorough testing.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Use pull requests for code reviews to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **Continuous Integration:** Establish automated testing pipelines to run unit and integration tests with each PR. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI can be integrated.

### Code Review Process
- **Peer Reviews:** All submitted code should undergo peer review to evaluate logic, performance, and security.
- **Review Checklist:** Ensure documentation is updated, code is well-commented, and tests are comprehensive before merging.
- **Merge Strategy:** Adopt a “squash and merge” or “rebase” strategy to maintain a clean commit history.

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing:** Use frameworks like Mocha or Jest to cover individual units of work.
- **Integration Testing:** Simulate real-world data flow across multiple components to test full API workflows.
- **Load Testing:** Consider tools like Apache JMeter or k6 for load testing critical endpoints and real-time communications.

---

## 7. Technical Decisions

- **API Design:** Choose RESTful endpoints with clear versioning guidelines and predictable behavior.
- **Database Selection:** Decide between SQL and NoSQL databases based on the data models and performance characteristics, considering future scalability.
- **Real-Time Framework:** Evaluate and select the most appropriate library for real-time interactions (e.g., Socket.IO) based on project complexity.
- **Security Practices:** Define policies for token expiration, secure storage, rate limiting, and input sanitization.
- **Caching Strategy:** Decide which parts of the application will benefit most from caching (e.g., frequently accessed profile data or skill listings) and select a caching solution like Redis.
  
These decisions should also be documented and shared with the team to maintain a consistent architecture throughout the project.
