## üìã Project Overview

SkillSwap Hub is an innovative web application that enables users to teach and learn various skills through peer-to-peer collaboration. The platform provides a safe and engaging environment where users can create profiles, list the skills they offer, and schedule interactive learning sessions with others. Using React on the frontend, the application boasts a responsive, intuitive user interface, ensuring that users have a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Node.js powers the backend API, handling authentication, data storage, and real-time communications via WebSockets. Users will enjoy a secure, JWT-based login system, integrated session scheduling, and a dynamic messaging system for immediate collaboration. The architecture is designed with scalability in mind, using RESTful services and modular components that facilitate quick enhancements and easy maintenance. Key challenges include managing real-time data syncing and ensuring responsive performance under load, which can be addressed by implementing caching and optimizing API endpoints. The implementation strategy involves setting up the core functionalities in the first month and refining UI/UX along with additional capabilities in the second month.
